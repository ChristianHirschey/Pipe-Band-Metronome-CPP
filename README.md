# Pipe Band Metronome
A basic console output metronome in C++ written using Windows API functions. It has normal metronomic functionality, but is especially intended for bagpipe sets, known as MSRs and Medleys which change time signature and tempo often.
Due to the fact that Windows API functions were used, this project will only work on windows devices. I hope to implement a PlaySound() function that works on all different types of devices at some point.
